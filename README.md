FOR RECRUITERS ðŸ’ª:
Thank you for checking me out! Be sure to head over to [my personal website](https://spencerheywood.com/) which has all the live links to some of my recent (self-hosted) personal projects.

Please note that my 'garden' is not a full representation of my coding activity. I recently became aware of a git configuration issue where my author email was capitalized which prevented the pull history from registering to my account. To avoid the dangerous tampering of the commit history of my group projects and smaller projects older than several months I have decided not to change the author email on those particular repositories. Rest asured that coding is a passon of mine and something I do just about every day!
